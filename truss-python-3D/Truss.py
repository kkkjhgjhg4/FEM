"""
Truss - truss FE analysis program.
  Element types  : 1-, 2- or 3-dimension linear bar element.
  Problem solved : truss whose Young's modulus, cross-sectional area are known within each element
    is deformed at nodal forces.

Usage:
   >>> Truss file_name
   
Command line arguments:
  file_name: File name in which the FE model is stored in json format
